# Weather-App
This is an weather app which is created by using HTML, CSS and Javascript with some APIs. When we click the search button after entering the name of the desired city then it shows the current temperature, humidity and wind speed of the city![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56d8ffa7-8160-4d7c-8c88-e159e6878074)
